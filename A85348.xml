            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Good NEWS for England, OR THE Heads of a PEACE PROPOS'D by the FRENCH KING.</head>
            <p>THE Kings of <hi>Sweden</hi> and <hi>Denmark</hi> have lately had a Project of Peace preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them by the French Envoys at their Courts, Monſieur <hi>D'Avaux,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Bowrepos:</hi> And to ſhew the world that their Maſter is in earneſt they tell the Northern Kings 'tis their Honor and Intereſt to preſs the Allies to accept it. They are almoſt angry with, tho they don't threaten thoſe Princes, but tell 'em it behoves 'em to procure this Peace, or elſe to joyn with one of the two Parties.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> charge the <hi>Dutch</hi> with being the occaſion of this War; but how fairly every common Eye can ſee: however they are willing to re-eſtabliſh Peace and Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick with the States General, as they were agreed on before this war begun.</p>
            <p>And the Moſt Chriſtian King deſires only the Reſtitution of what <hi>England</hi> has taken from him in the Iſlands and Continent of <hi>America, viz.</hi> St. <hi>Chriſtophers, &amp;c.</hi> and then he will reſtore and confirm the Treaties that have been broken by this war.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> pretends to be kind to <hi>Spain,</hi> tho ſhe does not deſerve it at her hands; for ſhe declar'd war againſt <hi>France. Mons</hi> and <hi>Namur,</hi> (which laſt is theirs already) ſhall be theirs again. They will keep <hi>Luxembourgh,</hi> which is a City and Province; a Dukedom of very large extent, and advantageouſly ſeated to aſſiſt them to carry their Arms into <hi>Germany.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> King is kind to the young Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and offers him very largely, and ſays, he cannot but return Thanks for his generous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of dealing with him upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France</hi> demands that the Treaties of <hi>Weſtphalia</hi> and <hi>Nimiguen</hi> may remain in their full force; and that which was concluded at <hi>Ratisbon</hi> in the year 1684 under the name of a Truce for Twenty years, may be chang'd into a definitive Treaty of Peace.</p>
            <p>They wou'd fain keep <hi>Strasburgh?</hi> which cannot be permitted, the States of <hi>Swabia</hi> and <hi>Franconia</hi> having pray'd His Imperial Majeſty by no means to agree to that; and add, they will rather make a new Levy of Ten Thouſand Men againſt the next Spring to carry on the war; and they are much in the right, for if <hi>Strasburgh</hi> remain in the <hi>French</hi> hands, the Empire will always be the ſtage of war.</p>
            <p>Next the moſt Chriſtian King offers to reſtore the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and its dependences to the Duke of <hi>Newbourgh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In compenſation for the City of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> and the Forts, of which the Moſt Chriſtian King is in Poſſeſſion, and which he will hold immutnably both for himſelf and his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors: firſt <hi>Montroyal,</hi> and <hi>Tarback,</hi> ſhall be demoliſh'd, and reſtor'd to the Prince to whom they belong, never to be Fortified again, during the Peace. Secondly, that all the Works of <hi>Fort Lewis,</hi> and <hi>Hunninghen</hi> that lie beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> in reſpect of <hi>France,</hi> ſhall be demoliſh'd: Thirdly, <hi>Philipsburgh</hi> with the Fort ſhall be ſurrendred, Fortified as they are; and <hi>Friburgh</hi> in the ſame condition it is.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:151150:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>As for the Dutchy of <hi>Deux Ponts,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King to reſign it to the King of <hi>Sweden</hi> in the ſame condition now it is, and never to lay claim to it for the future, tho by the Deeds and Evidences it appears that that ſame Dutchy depends upon the Biſhoprick of <hi>Ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Emperour having ſignified, that he is not willing the <hi>French</hi> ſhou'd remain in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Strasburgh,</hi> many reaſons are offer'd by the <hi>French,</hi> but nothing will do, for that City is too conſiderable to be quitted by the Empire.</p>
            <p>The Moſt Chriſtian King declares, that he has a cordial deſire to eſtabliſh a Peace that may maintain <hi>France,</hi> and the Empire in a laſting repoſe; that his Majeſty choſes rather to preſerve one City, <hi>viz. Strasburgh</hi> that lies next to <hi>France,</hi> and ſurrender up two, <hi>viz. Philipsburgh</hi> and <hi>Friburgh</hi> that lie next to <hi>Germany,</hi> to demoliſh ſo many ſtrong Fortreſſes, and reſtore ſo large an extent of Country.</p>
            <p>He is reſolv'd inviolably to obſerve the Peace, and hopes the Emperor will do the ſame, to prevent the effuſion of Chriſtian Blood.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty offers to reſtore to reſtore to <hi>Spain</hi> all the Places without any exception which he has won from that Crown.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> French <hi>are very unwilling to revive infinite Diſputes, which might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply matter for a new War, rather than a means to end this; they are not for cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out Negotiations that might laſt long, or take up too much time, they are for Demoliſhings and Reſtitutions, to reconcile all matters contained in former Treaties, and provide for the diuturnal ſecurity of the Empire, as well as that of</hi> France, <hi>and conſequently for a perpetual endurance of a firm and perfect Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence.</hi>
